# Evaluating SpikeNet on the Temporal Graph Benchmark  
We evaluated SpikeNet, a new biologically inspired temporal graph representation learning technique, on the recent Temporal Graph Benchmark. For the Node Classification task on $\texttt{tgbn-trade}$, SpikeNet is the worst performing technique, but is similarly competitive to other technical temporal graph representation learning techniques, suggesting model performance may be closely related to the dataset size regime: for small data regimes, the simplest model is preferred. For the Node Classification task on $\texttt{tgbn-genre}$, SpikeNet is the worst-performing technique among all the techniques.
